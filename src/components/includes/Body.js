        With its seamless customization options that make it the perfect
        addition to rooms of any size, it’s no wonder IKEA’s BILLY bookcase
        series has become a beloved classic around the world. BILLY bookcases
        are built with a stackable design that allows you to attach new units
        whenever you need additional storage, just decide on what height suits
        your space best. Every model in the BILLY series also features
        adjustable shelves so you can fit anything from books to trophies, and
        everything in between.
